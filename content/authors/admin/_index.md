Emil Chrisander applies statistical methods within econometrics and machine learning to answer research questions related to consumer choices. The focus of his research is to improve the understanding of human decision making by analyzing individual behavior stored in digital data. Currently he is analyzing the two-sided market of higher education. For example by evaluating the implications on student dropout by applying AI in the Admission Policy. 

Prior to his enrollment as PhD fellowship, Emil was the founder of a tech startup in Colombia and worked as a Management Consultant for two years. During his time as a Management Consultant he travelled the world to the globe to conduct in-depth customer interviews, estimated market demand through conjoint analyses, and gave corporate management advice on the pricing strategy of a multi-billion product.
